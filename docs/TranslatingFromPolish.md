## adiunkt

## dramatyczny

## kamienica

Do not translate _kamienica_ as _tenement_ or _tenement house_ unless you intend to emphasize the decrepit state of the building. Tenement has almost universally negative connotations in English (outside Scotland). With no direct equivalent available, simply translate _tenement_ as **building**, **residential building**, or **apartment building**.

## na terytorium

_On the territory of_ is a frequent mistranslation of _na terytorium_, especially in news copy translated from Polish, Russian, and Ukrainian. A simple **in** will usually suffice. **On \[Ukrainian\] soil** may also be used in more formal contexts, such as translations of official statements.  

## obiekt

In military and architectural contexts, it is usually incorrect to translate the Polish word _obiekt_ (or its Russian and Ukrainian counterparts, _объект_ and _об'єкт_) as _object_. **Building** or **target** are often the right words here.  

## ojczyzna

Avoid the tempting calque _fatherland_ or _motherland_, both of which carry specific connotations beyond the Polish word _ojczyzna_. **Homeland** is often the preferable translation.

## pełnomocnik

Avoid translating _pełnomocnik_ as _plenipotentiary_. While technically correct, the term is used much less frequently in English than it is in Polish. **Special government representative for X** is a better choice.

## prezydent

When referring to the top official in a major Polish city, translate _prezydent_ as **mayor**.

## przedstawiciel

_Przedstawiciel_ can be translated as _representative_ in certain contexts, but it is often used in Polish as a synonym of _członek_. In many cases, **member** will be a more accurate translation. 

## publicysta

Translate _publicysta_ as **columnist** or **journalist**, not _publicist_, which is a false friend.

## sekretarz stanu

Wherever possible, avoid translating the title _sekretarz stanu_ and _podsekretarz stanu_. **Deputy Minister** is more easily understood by foreign audiences, and is an accurate description of this position in the Polish political system,
