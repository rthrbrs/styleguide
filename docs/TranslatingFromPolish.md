## adiunkt

## dramatyczny

_Dramatic_ often fails to convey the intended meaning of _dramatyczny_, and can even come across as sarcastic. Consider alternative such as **serious**, **dire**, **grave**, **life-threatening**, **catastrophic**, or **disastrous**, depending on the context.

## kamienica

Do not translate _kamienica_ as _tenement_ or _tenement house_ unless you intend to emphasize the decrepit state of the building. Tenement has almost universally negative connotations in English (outside Scotland). With no direct equivalent available, simply translate _tenement_ as **building**, **residential building**, or **apartment building**.

## kancelaria

Avoid translating _kancelaria_ (_Kancelaria Premiera_, _Kancelaria Prezydenta_) as _chancellery_ in contexts where **office** is sufficient. _Chancellery_ is rarely used in English-language news, outside of references to the office of the [German Chancellor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/German_Chancellery). 

## kierunek


## komisja

The Polish word _komisja_ is used to describe a range of bodies that have two distinct names in English: **committee** and **commission**. In government, a **committee** usually comprises a group of legislators assembled to make a decision or produce a document such as a report. A **commission** is a body entrusted by the government to carry out a specific task. There is some overlap between the two terms. Which word to use when translating _komisja_ has to be determined on case-by-case basis. See [Polish Committees and Commissions](Committees.md).

## na terytorium

_On the territory of_ is a frequent mistranslation of _na terytorium_, especially in news copy translated from Polish, Russian, and Ukrainian. A simple **in** will usually suffice. **On \[Ukrainian\] soil** may also be used in more formal contexts, such as translations of official statements.  

## obiekt

In military and architectural contexts, it is usually incorrect to translate the Polish word _obiekt_ (or its Russian and Ukrainian counterparts, _объект_ and _об'єкт_) as _object_. **Building** or **target** are often the right words here.  

## ojczyzna

Avoid the tempting calque _fatherland_ or _motherland_, both of which carry specific connotations beyond the Polish word _ojczyzna_. **Homeland** is often the preferable translation.

## pełnomocnik

Avoid translating _pełnomocnik_ as _plenipotentiary_. While technically correct, the term is used much less frequently in English than it is in Polish. **Special government representative for X** is a better choice.

## prezydent

When referring to the top official in a major Polish city, translate _prezydent_ as **mayor**.

## przedstawiciel

_Przedstawiciel_ can be translated as _representative_ in certain contexts, but it is often used in Polish as a synonym of _członek_. In many cases, **member** will be a more accurate translation. 

## publicysta

Translate _publicysta_ as **columnist** or **journalist**, not _publicist_, which is a false friend.

## sekretarz stanu

Wherever possible, avoid translating the title _sekretarz stanu_ and _podsekretarz stanu_. **Deputy Minister** is more easily understood by foreign audiences, and is an accurate description of this position in the Polish political system,

## stan klęski żywiołowej, stan wyjątkowy

## zawiadomienie do prokuratury
