The following style guide standardizes the use of place names in spoken English, on-screen graphics, and written English published on the TVP World website.

## Location Strap Format

With a [handful](Places.md#luxembourg) of [exceptions](Places.md#jerusalem), the chyron specifying a location consists of two elements: a place name (a town, city, region, or other geographic feature) and the country within which it is located.

## When to Identify Locations

Only use location straps when they are required to provide the viewer with essential context.  Always identify locations in live reports and LTTs. In other situations, it is up to the reporter and editor to decide whether this chyron is necessary.

## Unknown, Unspecified, and Undisclosed Locations

Do not identify locations that are unknown or very broad. For example, avoid location straps such as "At Sea," "Outer Space" or "Russia," as they provide little or no addition information while cluttering up the screen. 

## Official and Common Country Names

When mentioning a country in a chyron, provide its common name rather than the official, longer one:

!!! success "Correct"

    * Poland
    * Russia
    * Iran

!!! failure "Incorrect"

    * The Republic of Poland
    * The Russian Federation
    * The Islamic Republic of Iran

## Spelling of Place Names

As a general rule, preserve the spelling of place names originally written in the Latin script, including any diacritical signs.

???+ note "Examples"

    * Łódź, Poland
    * Chișinău, Moldova
    * Székesfehérvár, Hungary

If a location has a well-established English name, that name takes precedence over the local spelling.

???+ note "Examples"

    * Krakow, Poland
    * Riga, Latvia
    * Reykjavik, Iceland
    * Istanbul, Turkey

## Transcribing from Non-Latin Scripts

In the case of place names not originally written in the Latin alphabet, default to the most commonly used transcription.

A convenient starting point for researching unfamiliar or rarely encountered toponyms is OpenStreetMap's search engine, [Nominatim](https://nominatim.openstreetmap.org/), which typically provides proper English transcriptions of place names around the world.

The choice of transcription can be fraught with political pitfalls. Choosing the wrong method of transcribing from one script into another can invite accusations of bias or even hostility. Be especially careful, for example, to transcribe Ukrainian toponyms in a manner that reflects the Ukrainian pronunciation and naming, rather than the outdated Russian/Soviet naming practices. See also: [Ukraine](Places.md#ukraine).

!!! success "Correct"

    * Kyiv
    * Kharkiv
    * Bakhmut
    * Luhansk
    * Ukraine

!!! failure "Incorrect"

    * Kiev
    * Kharkov
    * Artemivsk
    * Lugansk
    * The Ukraine

## New Country Names

A handful of countries have announced new official English names in recent years. Some of these names have gained broad acceptance, while others have yet to see widespread use. Refrain from using new country names before they are adopted by a majority of English-language news outlets. For example, say and write **the Czech Republic** and **Turkey** rather than **Czechia** and **Türkiye**.

## Azerbaijan

Use **Azerbaijani** when referring to the Republic of Azerbaijan and its citizens. When discussing the Turkic ethnic group inhabiting northern Iran and Azerbaijan, use the adjective **Azeri**. See also: [Former Soviet Republics](Places.md#former-soviet-republics).

### Nagorno-Karabakh

**[TO DO]**


## Bosnia and Herzegovina

## Czech Republic

## Israel and the Palestinian Territories

**TODO**

### Jerusalem

To avoid perceptions of bias with regard to the status of the city of Jerusalem, which remains unresolved, identify this location simply as **Jerusalem**, without mentioning the country.


### Gaza Strip

**TODO**

### West Bank

For places located in the West Bank, including Israeli settlements, write **West Bank** in the second part of the location strap.

???+ note "Example"
    
    Ramallah, West Bank  
    Maale Adumim, West Bank


## Kosovo

Citizens of Kosovo may be referred to as **Kosovar** or **Kosovan**. The adjectival form **Kosovo** is preferable when referring to authorities in Kosovo:

???+ note "Example"
    
    Kosovo President Vjosa Osmani

## Luxembourg

In chyrons, identify this location simply as Luxembourg.

## Monaco

In chyrons, identify this location simply as Monaco.

## North Macedonia

**TODO**

## Norway

When discussing the Polish Polar Station on the island of Spitsbergen, note that the archipelago is commonly referred to in English as **Svalbard**; Spitsbergen is only one of several islands.


## The Philippines

The adjective for people, offices, and institutions, etc., is **Philippine**. **Filipino** and **Filipina** may be used as demonyms to describe a man or woman, respectively, from the Philippines.

## Poland

As a general rule, spell place names in Poland as you would in Polish. Exceptions include places that have established names in English, such as the Vistula and Oder Rivers, and the city of Krakow, which has chosen this spelling as its official English name.

### _Województwa_, _powiaty_, _gminy_

If at all possible, do not burden the viewer with the minutiae of the Polish local government system. It is often preferable to discuss "local officials" or "regional authorities" than to provide the precise equivalent of a particular rung on the local government ladder. If the specific administrative unit must be mentioned (e.g., on a map or graph), use the following:

**voivodeship**  
województwo

**powiat**  
county

**gmina**  
commune

!!! note "Polish Voivodeships"

    * Greater Poland Voivodeship
    * Holy Cross Voivodeship
    * Kuyavian-Pomeranian Voivodeship
    * Lesser Poland Voivodeship
    * Łódź Voivodeship
    * Lower Silesian Voivodeship
    * Lublin Voivodeship
    * Lubusz Voivodeship
    * Mazovian Voivodeship
    * Opole Voivodeship
    * Podlaskie Voivodeship
    * Pomeranian Voivodeship
    * Silesian Voivodeship
    * Subcarpathian Voivodeship
    * Warmian-Masurian Voivodeship
    * West Pomeranian Voivodeship

## Serbia

Use **Serb** to refer to a person of Serbian ethnicity, including people living outside of Serbia proper (**Kosovo Serbs**, **Bosnian Serbs**). Use the adjective **Serbian** to describe something or someone related to Serbia, its culture, government, or language.

## Slovakia

Use **Slovak** to refer to a person belonging the majority Slavic ethnic group in Slovakia or the Slovak language. When referring to the country's government, institutions, or citizens (not all of whom are Slovak), use the word **Slovakian**.

## Former Soviet Republics

**TODO** 

* avoid the label "former Soviet Republic" unless absolutely necessary for context
* avoid translating specific administrative units such as _oblasts_
* do not transliterate place names based on the Russian spelling

## Turkey

**TODO**

## Ukraine

As mentioned [above](Places.md#spelling-of-place-names), avoid the use of Russian and Soviet-Era names such as "Kiev" and "the Ukraine."

### Chernobyl

As an exception to the above rule, use the well-established name **Chernobyl** when referring to the 1986 disaster, the **Chernobyl Nuclear Power Plant**, and the **Chernobyl Exclusion Zone**. The partially abandoned city in which the plant is located is **Chornobyl**, in keeping with Ukrainian spelling.

### Dnipro, Dnieper, Dnipropetrovsk Oblast

The city formerly known as Dnipropetrovsk is called **Dnipro**, as is the river on which it is situated. The corresponding regional administrative unit is **Dnipropetrovsk Oblast**.

### Oblasts

Do not refer to _oblasts_ unless it is absolutely necessary (e.g., on a map or graph). Use **region** instead.

## United Kingdom

Refer to the country as the **United Kingdom**. Only use **Great Britain** when discussing the island consisting of England, Scotland, and Wales.


## United States

Write **United States** or **U.S.** Avoid the name "USA" in spoken and written English. Likewise, do not use the abbreviation "US" without periods in chyrons, as it is identical to the first-person plural pronoun in all-caps contexts. Use the abbreviation **U.S.** as both an adjective and a noun.

For location straps in the U.S., list the **location, city, county, or state** followed by **United States**:

???+ note "Examples"
    Chicago, United States  
    Washington, D.C., United States  
    New York City, United States  
    Yellowstone National Park, United States  
    Massachusetts, United States
