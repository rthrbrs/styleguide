## Numbers

### TV, Website, and Social Media

Spell out millions and billions in headlines, stories, posts, and prompter text:

???+ note "Example"

    U.S. Senate passes $95 billion in war aid to Ukraine, Israel, and Taiwan

Use a comma as the thousands separator. Do not use a space or period:

!!! success "correct"

    * 10,000

!!! failure  "incorrect"

    * 10 000
    * 10.000

Use a period as the decimal separator. Do not use a comma:

!!! success "correct"

    * $5.7 million
    * 99.9%

!!! failure  "incorrect"

    * $5,7 million
    * 99,9%


### TV Prompter Text

Write out large numbers, currencies, and percentages in full. This is easier for anchors to read off a teleprompter:

* 10 thousand dollars
* 25 million voters
* 14 and a half billion euros
* 99 point 9 percent

### Ticker and On-Screen Graphics

Abbreviate million and billion to M and B, respectively.

* U.S. Senate passes $95B in aid to Ukraine, Israel, and Taiwan.


## Currencies
Where appropriate, convert currencies to dollars or euros. Do not mix different converted currencies in the same story.

[**TO DO**] Refer to U.S. dollars simply as **dollars**. Specify the country for all other dollar currencies, such as the Canadian dollar.

### Website and Social Media
In **headlines**, convert currencies into U.S. dollars or euros. In the **lead or text**, it is acceptable to mention the local currency on first reference, paired with the dollar or euro conversion in brackets. Use dollars or euros in subsequent references.

### TV, Website and Social Media

For the Polish currency, use the singular form _złoty_ (spelled in Polish) for both singular and plural, just as you would *yen* and *yuan*.

Avoid three-letter currency abbreviations such as USD, EUR, or PLN.

### Ticker

Convert all currencies to dollars or euros, placing the currency symbol before the amount, followed by B, M, or thousands: **€5B, €10M, $65,000**.
