## Hyphen

Use a hyphen to combine nouns and/or adjectives into compound terms.

???+ note "Examples"

    * UN Secretary-General
    * EXAMPLE
    * EXAMPLE

Use a hyphen when combining two or more words that collectively act as an adjective before a noun.

???+ note "Examples"

    * a 26-year-old male
    * surface-to-air missiles
    * EU-friendly reforms
    * rubber-stamp legislature

Do not use the hyphen as a punctuation mark.

!!! failure "Incorrect"

    The goal of joining the EU **-** as well as NATO **-** is even enshrined in Georgia’s constitution.

Use the hyphen (without spaces on either side) in double-barrelled surnames: 

???+ note "Example"

    * Władysław Kosiniak-Kamysz

## En-Dash

An en-dash (–) is wider than a hyphen. Use it to represent a span or range of numbers:

???+ note "Examples"

    * the 2011–2024 civil war
    * individuals aged 18–26

Use an en-dash when reporting scores or the results of votes. Do not use a colon (:).

???+ note "Examples"

    * Iga Świątek defeated Kamilla Rakhimova 6–4, 7–6.
    * The legislation passed the Senate by a vote of 63–36.

Finally, use the en-dash to combine a pair of nouns or a two adjectives when implying conflict, connection, or direction. 

???+ note "Examples"

    * Polish–Soviet War
    * Molotov–Ribbentrop Pact
    * Moscow–Washington hotline
    * London–Paris train


## Em-Dashes


Note that this form of punctuation is used much less frequently in English than it is in Polish.
