# General Guidelines

The following style guide standardizes the use of place names in spoken English, on-screen graphics, and written English published on the TVP World website.

## Azerbaijan

## Kosovo

Citizens of Kosovo may be refered to as **Kosovar** or **Kosovan**. The adjectival form **Kosovo** is preferable when referring to authorities in Kosovo:

> Kosovo President Vjosa Osmani

## Luxembourg

## The Philippines

The adjective for people, offices, and institutions, etc., is **Philippine**.

## Poland

### Oder River
### Krakow

## Serbia

Use **Serb** to refer to a person of Serbian ethnicity. Use the adjective **Serbian** to describe something related to Serbia or its language.

## Slovakia

## Ukraine

## United Kingdom

Use the adjective British rather than U.K. in namestraps. U.K. is an acceptable adjective in the ticker.

## United States
Write **United States** or **U.S.** Avoid the name "USA" in spoken and written English. Likewise, do not use the abbreviation "US" without periods, as it is identical to the first-person plural pronoun in all-caps contexts. Use the abbreviation **U.S.** as both an adjective and a noun.

For location straps in the U.S., list the **location, city, county, or state** followed by **United States**:

???+ note "Examples"
    Chicago, United States  
    Washington, D.C., United States  
    New York City, United States  
    Yellowstone National Park, United States  
    Massachusetts, United States

## New Country Names

A handful of countries have announced new official English names in recent years. Some of these names have gained broad acceptance, while others have yet to see widespread use. Refrain from using new country names before they are adopted by a majority of English-language news outlets.

???+ note "Examples"
    Myanmar (adjective: Burmese)  
    Eswatini  
    North Macedonia  
    (The) Czech Republic (_not_ ~~Czechia~~)      
    Turkey (not ~~TÃ¼rkiye~~)
