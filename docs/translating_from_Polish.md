# Translating from Polish

## kamienica

Do not translate _kamienica_ as _tenement_ or _tenement house_ unless you intend to emphasize the decrepit state of the building. Tenement has almost universally negative connotations in English (outside Scotland). With no direct equivalent available, simply translate _tenement_ as **building** or **residential building**.

## pełnomocnik

Avoid translating _pełnomocnik_ as _plenipotentiary_. While technically correct, the term is used much less frequently in English than it is in Polish. **Special government representative for …** is a better choice.

## prezydent

When referring to the top official in a major Polish city, translate _prezydent_ as **mayor**.

## publicysta

Translate _publicysta_ as **columnist** or **journalist**, not _publicist_, which is a false friend.
