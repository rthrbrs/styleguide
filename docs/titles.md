## General Guidelines

The following guidelines standardize the use of official titles in on-screen graphics, including namestraps, news tickers, and other chyrons.

In cases not covered by the guidelines below, use a standard two-part namestrap containing the person's function and organization or institution with which they are affiliated:

???+ note "Example"
    Anne Applebaum  
    Journalist, The Atlantic

For individuals who hold more than one position, choose the namestrap that is most relevant in the context of the coverage, not both.

???+ note "Example"
    Adam Bodnar  
    Polish Justice Minister

    _or_

    Adam Bodnar  
    Polish Public Prosecutor General

### Spelling

For names originally written in the Latin script, be sure to preserve all diacritical characters included in the original spelling. Do not "simplify" names for the sake of an English-speaking audience. 

???+ note "Example"
    Iga Świątek  
    Polish Tennis Player

In rare cases, an individual may choose not to use original diacritics, and instead goes by a modified "international" version of his or her name. In all cases, default to the person's personal preference, if it is known.

???+ note "Example"
    Novak Djokovic  
    Serbian Tennis Player

For names originally written in non-Latin scripts such as Cyrillic, use the Latin transliteration preferred by the individual in question, or the spelling most commonly used in English-language media. The English transliteration is always preferred, unless the person goes by a different spelling.

???+ note "Example"
    Volodymyr Zelenskyy  
    President of Ukraine

    Salome Zourabichvili  
    President of Georgia

Do not use the Polish transliteration of names originally written in other scripts:

!!! failure "Incorrect"

    Michaił Saakaszwili  
    Former President of Georgia

Do not copy blindly from Reuters, EBU, or other news sources. Always double-check spelling and make sure the namestrap matches our format.

### Abbreviations, Acronyms, and Initialisms

Abbreviated titles end in a period:

???+ note "Example"
    Dr.  
    Prof.  
    Sen.  
    Rep.  
    Fr.  
    Rev.  
    Gen.  
    Col.  

Avoid periods in acronyms and initialisms, with the exception of U.S. and U.K.:

???+ note "Example"
    U.S.  
    U.K.  
    EU  
    UN  
    NATO  
    PM  
    FM  

## Presidents and Vice-Presidents

 As a general rule, for presidents, the full title (_President of Poland_) is preferred in namestraps, while the condensed form (_Polish President_) is acceptable in the lower third (the ticker and caption) and in news copy.

### In namestraps

Write _President of X_, or use the short title if the full title is awkward or too long. 

???+ note "Examples"
    Joe Biden  
    President of the United States

    Kamala Harris  
    Vice President of the United States

    Recep Tayyip Erdoğan  
    President of Turkey

    Roberta Metsola  
    President of the European Parliament

    Ursula von der Leyen  
    President of the European Commission

    Min Aung Hlaing  
    Acting President of Myanmar


### In the lower third

Use the short form of the title in the lower third:

???+ note "Examples"

    U.S. President  
    Polish President  
    EC President

## Prime Ministers and Heads of Government

### In namestraps

Write _Prime Minister of X_ or _X Prime Minister_, especially the short title if the full title is awkward or too long. 

???+ note "Examples"
    
    Donald Tusk  
    Prime Minister of Poland
    
    Kier Starmer  
    British Prime Minister

    John Swinney  
    Scottish First Minister

    Olaf Scholz  
    Chancellor of Germany

### In the lower third

Use short and abbreviated forms of titles in the lower third:

???+ note "Examples"
    * Polish PM Donald Tusk
    * U.K. PM Kier Starmer

    
## Monarchs

In namestraps, list the monarch's title and country. The latter may be omitted for brevity or if the individual is widely known. 

???+ note "Examples"
    * Pope Francis
    * King Charles III
    * King Felipe VI of Spain
    * King Rama X of Thailand

    * Tamim bin Hamad Al Thani   
      Emir of Qatar

## Government Ministers and Cabinet Members

In namestraps, provide the person's country and position. Foreign Minister may be abbreviated to FM in chyrons. Remember that _defense_ is spelled with an _s_ in American English. Use this spelling unless referring to officials from the U.K. or Australia, where the official title is spelled with a _c_.

???+ note "Namestrap Examples"
    Radosław Sikorski  
    Polish Foreign Minister

    Antony Blinken  
    U.S. Secretary of State

    John Healey  
    British Defence Secretary

???+ note "Ticker Examples"
    * U.K. Foreign Secretary David Lammy
    * Ukrainian FM Andrii Sybiha

## Diplomats

When identifying ambassadors, consuls, and other diplomats, mention their home country and host country or city. Keep in mind that ambassadors are appointed _to_ countries, and the preposition is used in their titles, as well:

???+ note "Examples"
    Mark Brzezinski  
    U.S. Ambassador to Poland

    Piotr Serafin  
    Permanent Representative of Poland to the EU

    Bartosz Cichocki  
    Former Polish Ambassador to Ukraine

    Anna Clunes  
    British Ambassador to Poland

Do not use the possessive form of the host country (Germany's Ambassador).

The highest diplomatic representative of the Holy See (not the Vatican) holds the title of Apostolic Nuncio, rather than Ambassador. He serves at the Apostolic Nunciature, not an embassy.

!!! success "Correct"

    * Belgian Ambassador to Poland  
    * Czech Ambassador to the Holy See  
    * Apostolic Nuncio to Poland

!!! failure "Incorrect"

    * Belgium’s Ambassador to Poland  
    * Czech Ambassador to the Vatican  
    * Vatican Ambassador to Poland

## Members of Legislative Bodies

### In namestraps

Provide the country, appropriate abbreviation, and political party or bloc. The country may be omitted if this is unambiguous based on the person's function, as in the case of Israel, the only country whose legislators are titled Members of Knesset.

???+ note "Examples"
    Anna Maria Żukowska    
    Polish MP, The Left

    Dariusz Joński  
    Polish MEP, European People's Party

    Eero Heinäluoma  
    Finnish MEP, Socialists and Democrats

    Jeremy Hunt  
    British MP, Conservative

???+ note "Examples"
    Raja Krishnamoorthi  
    U.S. Democratic Representative

    Lindsey Graham  
    U.S. Republican Senator

### In the lower third

Use short and abbreviated forms in the ticker and caption.

???+ note "Examples"
    * Polish MP  
    * Austrian MEP  
    * U.K. MP  
    * U.S. Rep.  
    * U.S. Sen.

    U.S. Republican Presidential Nominee

    J.D. Vance  
    U.S. Republican Vice Presidential Nominee

    Kamala Harris  
    U.S. Democratic Presidential Nominee

--->

## Heads of International Organizations

In namestraps, provided the title used by person, with no additional information unless necessary.

???+ note "Examples"
    * UN Secretary-General  
    * NATO Secretary General

## Military Leaders

In the lower third, provide the person’s abbreviated military rank and office, where applicable:

???+ note "Examples"
    Gen. Charles Q. Brown, Jr.  
    Chairman of the U.S. Joint Chiefs of Staff

    Adm. William H. McRaven  
    U.S. Navy
    
    Gen. Oleksandr Syrskyi  
    Commander in Chief, Armed Forces of Ukraine

    Gen. Ben Hodges (Ret.)  
    Former Commander, U.S. Army Europe


## Academia, Think Tanks and Other Organizations

List the person’s **function** and **institution**, in that order, separated by a comma:

???+ note "Examples"
    * Vice-President, U.S. Institute of Peace
    * Head of Space Missions, NASA
    * Senior Fellow, Heritage Foundation
    * Levin Professor of History, Yale University

In English media, academic titles are used less frequently than in Poland. If a guest insists that you mention their degree, use Prof. or Dr. rather than Ph.D. Otherwise, use the title Dr. for medical doctors only.

## Clergy

Names of clergymen and women should be preceded by the person’s title (Father, Reverend, Rabbi, Sister) and, where applicable, followed by the abbreviation of their religious congregation (OP, SJ, OSF, etc.). Roman Catholic and Eastern Orthodox priests are typically styled Father (Fr.), while Anglican/Episcopal priests and some Protestant ministers take the title Reverend (Rev.). If the ordained person holds a church office, it should be listed after the comma. In some cases, this will make the preceding title superfluous:

???+ note "Examples"
    Fr. Mike Schmitz
    
    Rev. Jesse Jackson
    
    Br. Guy Consolmagno, SJ
    
    Abp. Wojciech Polak  
    Primate of Poland
    
    Laurent Ulrich  
    Archbishop of Paris

    Bartholomew I  
    Ecumenical Patriarch of Constantinople
    
    Epiphanius I  
    Metropolitan of Kyiv and All Ukraine

Note that the title of cardinal is traditionally placed between the first name and surname.

???+ note "Examples"
    Timothy Cardinal Dolan  
    Archbishop of New York
    
    Blase Cardinal Cupich  
    Archbishop of Chicago
