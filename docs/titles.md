title: Official Titles

## General Guidelines

The following guidelines standardize the use of official titles in on-screen graphics, including namestraps, news tickers, and other chyrons.

In cases not covered by the guidelines below, use a standard two-part namestrap containing the person's function and organization or institution with which they are affiliated:

???+ note "Example"
    Anne Applebaum  
    Journalist, The Atlantic

## Spelling

For names originally written in the Latin script, be sure to preserve all diacritical characters included in the original spelling. Do not "simplify" names for the sake of an English-speaking audience. 

???+ note "Example"
    Iga Świątek  
    Polish Tennis Player

In rare cases, an individual may choose not to use original diacritics, and instead goes by a modified "international" version of his or her name. In all cases, default to the person's personal preference, if it is known.

???+ note "Example"
    Novak Djokovic  
    Serbian Tennis Player

For names originally written in non-Latin scripts such as Cyrillic, use the Latin transliteration preferred by the individual in question, or the spelling most commonly used in English-language media. The English transliteration is always preferred, unless the person goes by a different spelling.

???+ note "Example"
    Volodymyr Zelenskyy  
    President of Ukraine

    Salome Zourabichvili  
    President of Georgia

Do not use the Polish transliteration of names originally written in other scripts:

!!! failure "Incorrect"

    Michaił Saakaszwili  
    Former President of Georgia

Do not copy blindly from Reuters, EBU, or other news sources. Always double-check spelling and make sure the namestrap matches our format.

## Presidents and Vice-Presidents

 As a general rule, for presidents, the full title (_President of Poland_) is preferred in namestraps, while the condensed form (_Polish President_) is acceptable in the lower third (the ticker and caption) and in news copy.

### In namestraps

Write _President of X_, or use the short title if the full title is awkward or too long. 

???+ note "Examples"
    Joe Biden  
    President of the United States

    Kamala Harris  
    Vice President of the United States

    Recep Tayyip Erdoğan  
    President of Turkey

    Roberta Metsola  
    President of the European Parliament

    Ursula von der Leyen  
    President of the European Commission

    Min Aung Hlaing  
    Acting President of Myanmar


### In the lower third

Use the short form of the title in the lower third:

???+ note "Examples"

    U.S. President  
    Polish President  
    EC President

## Prime Ministers and Heads of Government

### In namestraps

Write _Prime Minister of X_ or _X Prime Minister_, especially the short title if the full title is awkward or too long. 

???+ note "Examples"
    
    Donald Tusk  
    Prime Minister of Poland
    
    Kier Starmer  
    British Prime Minister

    John Swinney  
    Scottish First Minister

    Olaf Scholz  
    Chancellor of Germany

### In the lower third

Use short and abbreviated forms of titles in the lower third:

???+ note "Examples"
    Polish PM Donald Tusk

    U.K. PM Kier Starmer

    
## Monarchs

In namestraps, list the monarch's title and country. The latter may be omitted for brevity or if the individual is widely known. 

???+ note "Examples"
    Pope Francis
 
    King Charles III
     
    Tamim bin Hamad Al Thani   
    Emir of Qatar
    
    King Felipe VI of Spain
    
    King Rama X of Thailand
    

## Government Ministers and Cabinet Members

In namestraps, provide the person's country and position. Foreign Minister may be abbreviated to FM in the lower third. Remember that _defense_ is spelled with an _s_ in American English. Use this spelling unless referring to officials from the U.K. or Australia, where the official title is spelled with a _c_.

???+ note "Examples"
    Radosław Sikorski  
    Polish Foreign Minister

    Antony Blinken  
    U.S. Secretary of State

    John Healey  
    British Defence Secretary

???+ note "Ticker Examples"
    U.K. Foreign Secretary David Lammy

    Ukrainian FM Andrii Sybiha

## Diplomats

When identifying ambassadors, consuls, and other diplomats, mention their home country and host country or city. Keep in mind that ambassadors are appointed _to_ countries, and the preposition is used in their titles, as well:

???+ note "Examples"
    Mark Brzezinski  
    U.S. Ambassador to Poland

    Piotr Serafin  
    Permanent Representative of Poland to the EU

    Bartosz Cichocki

## Clergy

Names of clergymen and women should be preceded by the person’s title (Father, Reverend, Rabbi, Sister) and, where applicable, followed by the abbreviation of their religious congregation (OP, SJ, OSF, etc.). Roman Catholic and Eastern Orthodox priests are typically styled Father (Fr.), while Anglican/Episcopal priests and some Protestant ministers take the title Reverend (Rev.). If the ordained person holds a church office, it should be listed after the comma. In some cases, this will make the preceding title superfluous:

* Father Mike Schmitz
* Reverend Jesse Jackson
* Brother Guy Consolmagno, SJ
* Archbishop Wojciech Polak, Primate of Poland
* Laurent Ulrich, Archbishop of Paris
* Bartholomew I, Ecumenical Patriarch of Constantinople
* Epiphanius I, Metropolitan of Kyiv and All Ukraine
