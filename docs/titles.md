Names of clergymen and women should be preceded by the person’s title (Father, Reverend, Rabbi, Sister) and, where applicable, followed by the abbreviation of their religious congregation (OP, SJ, OSF, etc.). Roman Catholic and Eastern Orthodox priests are typically styled Father (Fr.), while Anglican/Episcopal priests and some Protestant ministers take the title Reverend (Rev.). If the ordained person holds a church office, it should be listed after the comma. In some cases, this will make the preceding title superfluous:

* Father Mike Schmitz
* Reverend Jesse Jackson
* Brother Guy Consolmagno, SJ

* Epiphanius I, Metropolitan of Kyiv and All Ukraine

**Do not translate _pełnomocnik_ as _plenipotentiary_:**

* Special Representative for Strategic Energy Infrastructure
* ~~Government Plenipotentiary~~ for Strategic Energy Infrastructure

**Other frequently mistranslated titles:**
