Academic titles are used less frequently in English-speaking countries than in Poland. If a guest insists that you mention their degree, use Prof. or Dr. rather than Ph.D. Otherwise, use the title Dr. for medical doctors only.

## Clergy

Names of clergymen and women should be preceded by the person’s title (Father, Reverend, Rabbi, Sister) and, where applicable, followed by the abbreviation of their religious congregation (OP, SJ, OSF, etc.). Roman Catholic and Eastern Orthodox priests are typically styled Father (Fr.), while Anglican/Episcopal priests and some Protestant ministers take the title Reverend (Rev.). If the ordained person holds a church office, it should be listed after the comma. In some cases, this will make the preceding title superfluous:

* Father Mike Schmitz
* Reverend Jesse Jackson
* Brother Guy Consolmagno, SJ
* Archbishop Wojciech Polak, Primate of Poland
* Laurent Ulrich, Archbishop of Paris
* Bartholomew I, Ecumenical Patriarch of Constantinople
* Epiphanius I, Metropolitan of Kyiv and All Ukraine

##### Note that the title of cardinal is traditionally placed between the first name and surname:

## Other Guidelines

##### If an official holds more than one title, list the one that is more important or more relevant to the subject at hand:

* Mariusz Błaszczak, Minster of Defense
_or_
* Mariusz Błaszczak, Polish Defense Minister

##### Do not translate _pełnomocnik_ as _plenipotentiary_:

* Special Representative for Strategic Energy Infrastructure
* ~~Government Plenipotentiary~~ for Strategic Energy Infrastructure

##### Other frequently mistranslated titles:
* _publicysta_ → columnist (_not_ ~~publicist~~)
