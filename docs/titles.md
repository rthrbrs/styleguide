title: Official Titles

## General Guidelines

The following guidelines standardize the use of official titles in on-screen graphics, including namestraps, news tickers, and other chyrons.

In cases not covered by the guidelines below, use a standard two-part namestrap containing the person's function and organization or institution with which they are affiliated:

???+ note "Example"
    Anne Applebaum  
    Journalist, The Atlantic

## Spelling

For names originally written in the Latin script, be sure to preserve all diacritical characters included in the original spelling. Do not "simplify" names for the sake of an English-speaking audience. 

???+ note "Example"
    Iga Świątek  
    Polish Tennis Player

In rare cases, an individual may choose not to use original diacritics, and instead goes by a modified "international" version of his or her name. In all cases, default to the person's personal preference, if it is known.

???+ note "Example"
    Novak Djokovic  
    Serbian Tennis Player

For names originally written in non-Latin scripts such as Cyrillic, use the Latin transliteration preferred by the individual in question, or the spelling most commonly used in English-language media. The English transliteration is always preferred, unless the person goes by a different spelling.

???+ note "Example"
    Volodymyr Zelenskyy  
    President of Ukraine

    Salome Zourabichvili  
    President of Georgia

Do not copy blindly from Reuters, EBU, or other news sources. Always double-check spelling and make sure the namestrap matches our format. 

## Presidents and Vice-Presidents

 As a general rule, for presidents, the full title (_President of Poland_) is preferred in namestraps, while the condensed form (_Polish President_) is acceptable in the lower third (the ticker and caption) and in news copy.

### In namestraps

Write _President of X_, or use the short title if the full title is awkward or too long. 

???+ note "Examples"
    Volodymy Zelenskyy  
    President of Ukraine

    Joe Biden  
    President of the United States

    Kamala Harris  
    Vice President of the United States

    Roberta Metsola  
    President of the European Parliament

    Ursula von der Leyen  
    President of the European Commission

    Min Aung Hlaing  
    Acting President of Myanmar


### In the lower third

Use the short form of the title in the lower third:

???+ note "Examples"

    U.S. President  
    Polish President  
    EC President

## Prime Ministers and Heads of Government

### In namestraps

Write _Prime Minister of X_ or _X Prime Minister_, especially the short title if the full title is awkward or too long. 

???+ note "Examples"

Academic titles are used less frequently in English-speaking countries than in Poland. If a guest insists that you mention their degree, use Prof. or Dr. rather than Ph.D. Otherwise, use the title Dr. for medical doctors only.

Names of clergymen and women should be preceded by the person’s title (Father, Reverend, Rabbi, Sister) and, where applicable, followed by the abbreviation of their religious congregation (OP, SJ, OSF, etc.). Roman Catholic and Eastern Orthodox priests are typically styled Father (Fr.), while Anglican/Episcopal priests and some Protestant ministers take the title Reverend (Rev.). If the ordained person holds a church office, it should be listed after the comma. In some cases, this will make the preceding title superfluous:

* Father Mike Schmitz
* Reverend Jesse Jackson
* Brother Guy Consolmagno, SJ
* Archbishop Wojciech Polak, Primate of Poland
* Laurent Ulrich, Archbishop of Paris
* Bartholomew I, Ecumenical Patriarch of Constantinople
* Epiphanius I, Metropolitan of Kyiv and All Ukraine
