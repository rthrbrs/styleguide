## General Guidelines

The following style guide standardizes the use of place names in spoken English, on-screen graphics, and written English published on the TVP World website.

## Serbia and Kosovo
Use **Serb** to refer to a person of Serbian ethnicity. Use the adjective **Serbian** to describe something related to Serbia or its language.

Citizens of Kosovo may be refered to as **Kosovar** or **Kosovan**. The adjectival form **Kosovo** is preferable when referring to authorities in Kosovo:

* Kosovo President Vjosa Osmani

## Ukraine

## United States
Write **United States** or **U.S.** Avoid the form “USA” in spoken and written English. Likewise, do not use the abbreviation “US” without periods, which is identical to the first-person plural pronoun in all-caps contexts. Use the abbreviation **U.S.** as both an adjective and a noun.

Mention the state or district and country when identifying locations in the United States:

* Chicago, IL, U.S.
* Washington, DC, U.S.
* New York, NY, U.S.
* Yellowstone National Park, WY, U.S.

## New Country Names
A handful of countries have announced new official English names in recent years. Some of these names have gained broad acceptance, while others have yet to see widespread use. Refrain from using new country names before they are adopted by a majority of English-language news outlets.

* Myanmar (adjective: Burmese)
* Eswatini
* North Macedonia
* ~~Czechia~~ (the Czech Republic)
* ~~Türkiye~~ (Turkey)
